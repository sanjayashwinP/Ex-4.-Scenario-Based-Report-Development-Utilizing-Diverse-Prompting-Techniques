Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.

### Name: Sanjay Ashwin P
### Reg no: 212223040181
## Aim: 
To design and develop an AI-powered chatbot using diverse prompting techniques that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and enhance customer experience in a retail environment.
## Algorithm: 
Step 1: Problem Definition
• Identify the retail environment scenario (e.g., an online clothing store).
• Define customer needs (product inquiries, order status, returns, complaints).
Step 2: Data Collection
• Gather frequently asked questions (FAQs), support scripts, and product data.
Step 3: Prompting Techniques Selection
• Choose diverse AI prompting methods (zero-shot, few-shot, chainof-thought, role prompting, persona-based, self-consistency).
Step 4: Prompt Design & Experimentation
• Construct different prompts for the same scenario using each technique.
• Collect chatbot outputs.
Step 5: Evaluation
• Compare outputs for correctness, coherence, personalization, and customer satisfaction.
Step 6: Report Generation
• Document the process, results, and analysis.
## Prompt:
Develop a scenario-based report on designing and implementing an AIpowered chatbot for retail customer support. Apply diverse prompting techniques (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Role-based, Chain-of-Thought, Personabased, Instruction-based, and Scenario-based)
## Output:

## 3. Use Case Scenario
### Retail Context
A retail store chatbot should support:  
- **Product Availability:** "Do you have sneakers in size 9?"  
- **Refund/Exchange:** "I bought shoes last week, but they don’t fit. How can I exchange them?"  
- **Recommendations:** "Suggest me running shoes under $80."  
- **Order Tracking:** "Where is my order #12345?"  

### Sample Customer Query
> “Hi, I purchased a pair of shoes last week, but the size doesn’t fit. How can I exchange them?”

This query tests the chatbot’s ability to handle **policy-driven customer service**.  

---

## 4. Prompting Techniques Applied

### 4.1 Zero-Shot Prompting
**Prompt:**  
Answer the customer’s query about exchanging shoes in a polite and professional way.

**Expected:** Fast, general response. May lack specific policy details.  

---

### 4.2 Few-Shot Prompting
**Prompt:**  
Example 1:
Customer: I want to return a jacket.
Bot: Sure! Please provide your order number, and I will help you with the return process.

Example 2:
Customer: Can I exchange shoes for a different size?
Bot: Absolutely! Exchanges are available within 30 days. Please provide your order ID.

Now, answer:
Customer: I purchased a pair of shoes last week, but the size doesn’t fit. How can I exchange them?

**Expected:** Learns from examples → more aligned with store policy.  

---

### 4.3 Role-Based Prompting
**Prompt:**  
You are a retail customer support agent.
Be polite, empathetic, and precise.
Guide the customer through the exchange process step by step.

**Expected:** Human-like interaction with empathy and professionalism.  

---

### 4.4 Chain-of-Thought Prompting
**Prompt:**  
Think step by step like a retail support agent:

Identify purchase details

Check if the exchange is within timeframe

Explain next steps clearly

Customer: I purchased a pair of shoes last week, but the size doesn’t fit. How can I exchange them?

**Expected:** Structured reasoning, clear and logical answer.  

---

### 4.5 Persona-Based Prompting
**Prompt:**  
You are a friendly store assistant named Alex.
You enjoy helping customers find the right fit.
Be empathetic and conversational while explaining the exchange process.


**Expected:** Personalized tone, builds customer trust.  

---

### 4.6 Instruction-Based Prompting
**Prompt:**  
Follow these instructions carefully:

Acknowledge the customer’s concern.

Reassure them about the exchange process.

Request their order ID.

Provide clear steps for the exchange.

yaml
Copy code
**Expected:** Clear compliance with structured instructions.  

---

### 4.7 Scenario-Based Prompting
**Prompt:**  
Scenario: A customer purchased shoes last week that do not fit.
The store allows exchanges within 30 days.
Explain politely how the customer can proceed with an exchange.


**Expected:** Context-aware, realistic response simulating real-world scenario.  

---

## 5. Data Collection
- Platforms tested: **ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cohere, Llama**  
- Responses generated for each **technique × model** combination  
- Metrics evaluated (0–5 scale):  
  - Accuracy  
  - Clarity

## 10. Future Enhancements
-  Multi-turn dialogue with memory for personalized support  
-  API integration with **inventory, order tracking, payment systems**  
-  Multi-modal support (voice, receipt image upload, barcode scanning)  
-  Hybrid prompting (Role + Scenario + Instruction) for maximum reliability  
-  Fine-tuning open-source models (Llama/Mistral) for cost efficiency  

---

## 11. Conclusion
- **Zero-Shot** → Fast, generic, low accuracy  
- **Few-Shot** → Learns from examples, better for retail  
- **Role-Based** → Best for empathy and customer satisfaction  
- **Chain-of-Thought** → Excellent for structured, logical problem-solving  
- **Persona-Based** → Human-like, trust-building but less formal  
- **Instruction-Based** → Highly structured, reliable for customer processes  
- **Scenario-Based** → Best overall technique, context-rich, closest to real retail interaction
- 
 **Recommendation:**  
Use a **hybrid strategy combining Scenario-Based + Instruction-Based + Role-Based prompting** for the most effective **retail chatbot deployment**.  

---

## Result:
The analysis shows that Role-based prompting delivers the best customer experience through professionalism and empathy, while Instruction-based prompting is the most efficient for quick, simple support. Few-shot prompting provides richer, detailed answers but at the cost of efficiency, whereas Zero-shot and One-shot prompting are faster but less personalized.
